### Description

>   The Earth united kingdom is a elective constitutional monarchy  created in 3028 after the Earthling confederation in the northwest of the quadrant. This country is the origin of all human species in the quadrant and is responsible for the three great waves of colonization. It is led by a king assisted by the council of senators to implement initiatives for the advancement of the country. Since the end of the Terran-Volcanid War, the Kingdom has been gaining strength and projecting its military forces more and more into the rest of the quadrant due to an increasingly interventionist spirit.


### The knights of Alpha Centauri

>   The Knights of Alpha Centauri are a renowned group of infantry soldiers in the Earth United Kingdom, known for their overwhelming armor and firepower. They first appeared in the final battle of the Eldoenni Independence War, the Battle of Alpha Primaris, where they suffered heavy casualties but were able to retreat.

Despite this initial defeat, the Knights of Alpha Centauri went on to prove their worth in later battles. They played a crucial role in the defense of the Lonides system during the First Galactic War, known as "Lonides Hell," where they fought against the Havritics and suffered immense casualties. The Knights also participated in the Battle of the Two Empires, the climax of the First Galactic War, where they played a key role in breaking through enemy lines and securing a crucial victory for the Earth United Kingdom.

The Knights of Alpha Centauri are led by Grand Master Andre√Ø of Lonides, a seasoned veteran who has led the Knights through countless battles. Under his leadership, the Knights have become one of the most feared and respected units in the Earth United Kingdom's military.

Despite their fearsome reputation, the Knights of Alpha Centauri are known for their unwavering sense of duty and sacrifice. They are deeply loyal to their country and will stop at nothing to defend it, even at the cost of their own lives.
