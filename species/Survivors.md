### General info / description
>   The survivors possess a humanoid appearance, being created by the Colonials to resemble them. In this case, their appearances depend mostly on whether they are complex or simple survivors. When they are complex survivors, their names always start with CS_[numbers]_”nickname” where CS stands for Complex survivors. Their appearance is the most human-like, with a height of 1.8 meters and resembling a male or a female. Despite having emotions, some rumors suggest that certain survivors gain the ability to reproduce, but many consider this rumor to be just hopeful speculation about the survivors becoming a new form of life.
>
>   The simples vary widely in size and appearance. Their names are not as complex and typically follow the pattern SiS_[Numbers]_[Role]. For example, a simple survivor who is a miner might have a drill instead of a hand and range in size from 4.5 meters to 10 meters long or high.
>
>   There are also rumors that survivors were created at the start of the human golden age on Earth during the 23rd century. These rumors speak of a bunker hidden in North America that is still sending signals relaying data to a bunker somewhere in Russia where the first survivors were created. However, to this day, those signals have not been discovered, so these theories cannot be proven.
