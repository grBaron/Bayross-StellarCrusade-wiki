##  Lore

>   The minor berserker is the most feeble form of the wild berserker, created from the loss of control during a berserker state. They are unable to regain their composure and instead live as savage animals, driven purely by instinct and primal urges. These creatures are a constant danger to anyone who crosses their path, as they are fiercely territorial and will attack without hesitation. While they may lack the intelligence and strength of their more powerful counterparts, their wild and unpredictable nature makes them a formidable foe in their own right.
